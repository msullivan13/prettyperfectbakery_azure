            <h3 class="name">Our Backstory</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Pretty Perfect Bakery began in 2004 when our two founders traveled overseas for a job opportunity, driven by their love for smiles, they decided to open a bakery in Lakeland, Florida. From then, their business has expanded to include neighboring cities. What started as a little shop in South Lakeland, has grown into three locations, with the goal of more across Florida and into other states to share their passion for delicious treats.
